# Roots (Consonants)
v = voiced
u = unvoiced
p = plosive
f = fricative

## Square arrangement
    vp up
    vf uf

The unvoiced plosive (the top, right corner "up) is considered the core root, 
and is used to refer the other sounds.  It occurs on the left since unvoiced
roots appear on the left of the stem.
